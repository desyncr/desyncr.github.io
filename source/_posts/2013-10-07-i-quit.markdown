I just quit.

I'm still a bit excited. Don't really know what to do. I just did.
Now the scary and unsettling future is all I have. Despair.
Yet, there is this feeling of relief. Free at last. A bittersweet taste in my month. A little grief in my heart.

To all whom I appreciate: Good bye.

There is no way back, only forward. That's where I'm looking.
