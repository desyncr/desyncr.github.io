## A demotivated non-engaging environment

Unless you're a rock-star programmer or you run your own business, there are chances you don't like how things get done where you work. If you're a rock-star programmer you can easily choose where to work, you've trillion job offers at the most varied places.
Things are different when you just started and can't separate yourself from the crowd. You take jobs are chances to grow up. To learn and become a better professional.

Chances are you found a nice place to work, with a nice environment to grow and learn everyday, or not. You may end at a bloodsucking, soul crushing job where there is no feedback and you're just another tool.
<!-- more -->

Don't take me wrong. You can work with great people, and the human factor is always important. But what is more import is the environment: a fertile environment to grow. To become better at what you do. 

Of course this is a business, things needs to be done and there is no time to try out your new bleeding-edge technology that nobody knows, yet. The oposite is true aswell. Being too focused on the delivery that there is no time to discuss how things get done, as they'd beed done this way and it works, there is no need to change it. Right? "right".

Sadly, there are no chances here. Once the company has raised some form of environment and workflow, there is no way to change it for worse or better. Not from the perspective of a developer.

## The challenge in not yours 

A reason for a lack of motiviation is the lack of challenges. A challenging position make you grow, either by crashing your self-steem through a failed project or by give you security by a sucessful one.
Either way, you learn something and grow. Become better.

What's the point of doing the same job every single day? Catching up on the current used technology just as far as you can deploy it. No more, no less.

This is again a problem with the idea of your job being a means to something, and not an end. Being a tool versus being part of something. You spend 8 hours a day sitting your ass on chair in front of a computer (what a depressive image, isnt?), can't you ask something back? other than money? Of course! And if they wont give you anything back... time to move!
